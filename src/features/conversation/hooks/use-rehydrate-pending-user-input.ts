/**
 * DB-truth rehydration for a stuck "Awaiting answer" question.
 *
 * The interactive AskUserQuestion / elicitation panel is driven by the
 * in-memory `pendingUserInput` zustand slice, which is populated ONLY by a
 * live `userInputRequest` stream event (see `dispatch-stream-event.ts`). That
 * slice does not survive a webview reload, and `useWatchSessionStream`
 * deliberately ignores `userInputRequest` for turns this client didn't start.
 *
 * So after a reload / re-attach the user is left with the read-only
 * "Question — Awaiting answer" transcript card (rendered from the persisted
 * thread) but NO way to answer — the turn is still parked in the sidecar
 * waiting on the user, forever.
 *
 * This hook reconciles the two. When the displayed session's persisted thread
 * ends in a `user-question` part that is still `pending`, and there is no live
 * `pendingUserInput` for the context, it reconstructs a `PendingUserInput`
 * from the persisted part so the interactive panel reappears. The panel's
 * answer routes back by `userInputId` (the persisted part's `id` IS the
 * tool-use id the sidecar keys its parked waiter on), so submitting resumes
 * the parked turn exactly as the live path would have.
 *
 * It also clears a now-stale live `pendingUserInput` when the persisted
 * question has flipped away from `pending` (e.g. answered from another window
 * / the mobile companion), so a resolved panel doesn't linger.
