"grex": patch

Improve the Cursor (Composer) provider:

- MCP servers configured in Cursor (e.g. Linear, Context7) now work in Cursor agent sessions and render with their tool name, server, and an MCP icon, matching Claude and Codex.
- Cursor progress now appears as discrete step-by-step updates instead of accumulating into one ever-growing paragraph.
- A Cursor authentication error in one workspace no longer halts active Cursor sessions in your other workspaces.
