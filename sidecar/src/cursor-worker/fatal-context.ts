 * Auth faults are per-stream — a `[unauthenticated]` / 401 status is returned
 * on one session's specific stream and doesn't kill siblings — so we trust the
 * async-context attribution (`attributedSessionId`) and scope the failure to
 * just that session (the cascade fix).
 *
 * Network/connection faults may instead be connection-level: if the SDK pools
 * one HTTP/2 connection across sessions, a GOAWAY/RST kills every stream but
 * surfaces in only one session's async context. Attributing those would leave
 * the real victims hung (no terminal event ever fires), so for non-auth faults
 * we fall back to the blunt-but-safe "fail every in-flight turn" — except when
 * a lone turn is live, which is unambiguous regardless of cause.
